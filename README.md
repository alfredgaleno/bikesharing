# Bike Sharing Analysis


## Overview
This analysis utilized data on bike sharing from Citi Bike to see trends in bike usage. We analyzed the data based on the times bikes were checked out as well as what gender checked them out
more often. We used the start and end locations as well to help detrmine the best use of maintenance assets. Using the information we gathered it is clear that the majority of bikes are used in Manhattan
and also left there. The key morning and evening commuting hours also account for the time when bikes are generally checked out.

## Summary

As seen in the visualizations above the best time to work on the bikes would be early morning and focusing on the bikes in Manhattan. There is a clear difference between male and female ridership. THe majority of mikes are used to commute and then on weekends to travel around as well. An analysis could be conducted on what locations have the least female ridership to in order to get information on what locations to market to in order to drive usage. In addition an analysis could be done on the female subscribers to see other trends in their ridership and if a referral program could be used to bring in more female subscribers.
