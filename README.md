# Bike Sharing Analysis


## Overview
This analysis utilized data on bike sharing from Citi Bike to see trends in bike usage. We analyzed the data based on the times bikes were checked out as well as what gender checked them out
more often. We used the start and end locations as well to help detrmine the best use of maintenance assets. Using the information we gathered it is clear that the majority of bikes are used in Manhattan
and also left there. The key morning and evening commuting hours also account for the time when bikes are generally checked out.
